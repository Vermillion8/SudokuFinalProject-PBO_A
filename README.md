This is a Sudoku game implemented using JavaFX made for my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) class. It allows players to play Sudoku puzzles on their computer. The game provides a graphical user interface with interactive features.

## **Dependencies**
+ **JavaFX**: Make sure you have JavaFX installed and configured properly in your development environment.

## **Usage**
+ Ensure that you have the JavaFX dependencies set up correctly.
+ Run the program by executing the main method.
+ A window will appear with the game menu.
+ Click on the "Play" button to start playing Sudoku. This will open a difficulty picker window.
+ Select the desired difficulty level.
+ The Sudoku game grid will appear on the screen.
+ Use the mouse to select cells and enter numbers into the grid.
+ The game will check the entered numbers for correctness.
+ Continue filling in the grid until you complete the Sudoku puzzle.
+ If you want to reset the game, click on the "Reset" button.
+ If you want to exit the game, click on the "Exit" button.

## **Limitations**
